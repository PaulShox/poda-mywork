Analysis of the Palmer Penguins dataset

## Dataset Overview
The Palmer Penguin dataset contains data about three penguin species located on three islands (Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen) in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. The three penguin species are Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap. The data was gathered by Dr. Kristen Gorman between the years 2007 to 2009.   

In total, data was gathered on 344 penguins using 14 variables. This dataset is a condensed version of the original dataset and contains 8 variables. They are reflected in the column names and are:
species; island; bill_length_mm; bill_depth_mm; flipper_length_mm; body_mass_g; sex; year   

The dataset was sourced from the github page of Alison Horst ![Palmer Penguins Dataset](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/blob/main/inst/extdata/penguins.csv), who developed the dataset along with Dr. Alison Hill and Dr. Kristen B. Gorman.
