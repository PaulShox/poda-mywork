## About the Dataset
- The Palmer Penguin dataset contains data about three penguin species located on three islands (Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen) in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. 
- The three penguin species are Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap. 
- The data was gathered by Dr. Kristen Gorman between the years 2007 to 2009.   

- In total, data was gathered on 344 penguins using 14 variables. 
- This dataset is a condensed version of the original dataset and contains 8 variables. 
- They are reflected in the column names and are:
    - species; island; bill_length_mm; bill_depth_mm; flipper_length_mm; body_mass_g; sex; year   

- The [dataset](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/blob/main/inst/extdata/penguins.csv) was sourced from the github page of Alison Horst, who developed the dataset along with Dr. Alison Hill and Dr. Kristen B. Gorman.
